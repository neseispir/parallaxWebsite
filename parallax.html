          tools from a project-based curriculum. Make projects to fill your

          Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the
          Internet.
          <span style="font-weight: bold"
            >Many businesses today need secure data processing and management
            platforms.</span
          >
          Cloud computing service providers offer reasonable solutions to these
          needs such as content delivery, database storage, and much more. Rather
          than owning their own computing infrastructure or data centers,
          companies can rent access to many resources ranging from applications to
          storage via a cloud service provider like AWS.
